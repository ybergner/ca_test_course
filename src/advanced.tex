\begin{edXproblem}{Matrix expression equality}

This problem demonstrates testing of matrix expression equality.  It properly handles the non-commutativity of matrices.

Let $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ be the usual Pauli matrices,
\bea
     	X &=& \mattwoc{0}{1}{1}{0}
\\ 	Y &=& \mattwoc{0}{-i}{i}{0}
\\ 	Z &=& \mattwoc{1}{0}{0}{-1}
\,.
\eea
Give an expression $M$ equal to $iZ$.

Valid answers include {\tt\LARGE X*Y} and {\tt\LARGE i*Z}.  But {\tt\LARGE Y*X} is properly graded as being invalid.

Note that {\LARGE\tt  X * exp(-i*Y) * Y * exp(i*Y)} also works (matrix
exponentials do the correct thing -- although, unfortunately, the edX
edge system doesn't provide {\LARGE\tt scipy.linalg}, and so it will
not work there).

% The following code imports matrix_evaluator from the course
% /python_lib directory of python code.
%
% Using the library makes it possible to efficiently re-use code
% and write modular code with well-defined scope.
%
% This works fine with an LMS using direct import of XML code.
%
% Unfortunately, the edX Studio system is broken, in that it does
% not allow use of /python_lib or /code directories of python
% code libraries.  Thus, for this demo to work on the edx.org
% Studio system, we are forced to paste all the python code

\begin{edXshowhide}{studioproblem}{Implementation notes and limits of edX studio}
The checking of this formula is done using a somewhat extensive python
script.  The edX platform allows such python scripts to be stored in
the course /python_lib or /code directory.  This means that each
problem can simply have a short script with a python ``import'' line
to retrieve the library functions.

This works very well when you are authoring the course directly in
XML, and not via uploading to edX Studio.

Unfortunately, the edX Studio system is broken, in that it does
not allow use of /python_lib or /code directories of python
code libraries.  Thus, for this demo to work on the edx.org
Studio system, we are forced to paste all the python code
in each problem, instead of importing it using normal semantics.

Note that edX Studio also does not allow a hierarchy of directories in
the /static directory: all files uploaded to Studio are stored flat in
that directory.  This means that HTML or javascript files which
attempt to load files from subdirectories will break, when using
Studio.  

Alas.  Maybe someday Studio will be fixed to work better.

\begin{edXproblem}{Quantum mechanics ket input}{attempts=1000 weight=10}

Quantum mechanics uses ``ket'' notation like $|\psi\>$ to indicate unit
vectors.

This problem demonstrates how to use customresponse python code to
check for equality of formulas with such ket notation, as well as a
javascript pre-processor to properly format ket expressions.

Type in {\tt (2*|0>+3*|b>)/sqrt(13)} as the answer below.

Multiple correct answer are supported.  {\tt |b>} is also correct, in
this example.

Note that correctness of the student's input expression is checked by
python code running on the server.  edx.org limits CPU time and memory
available to the code, and thus only 10 random vector samples can be
checked on this site.  Other systems, such as the residential MITx
system, are more accommodating, and allow enough resources to check 50
or more random samples, thus lowering the probability of mistaken
correctness.

The $\hat{n}$ vector goes through the point $(\theta, \phi)$ specified
in polar coordinates, with $\phi=0$ and

   = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{2V}{\omega_0}\right)

\eea
In terms $\theta$, the eigenstates may be expressed as
\bea

\begin{edXscript}
eh = {'range':[ 280, 290 ],

\end{edXscript}

\edXincludepy{XML/magnitude_hint2.py}

This problem demonstrates the ability to give hints when students
enter numerical answers which are too far from the expected result.

The correct answer is 177.  Try typing in 1 or 280 instead (you'll get hints).

How does the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density}{energy
  density} of \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum}{crude oil}
$E_{\rm oil}$ compare with the energy density of hot
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy}{geothermal}
fluid $E_{\rm geo}$?

Model the geothermal fluid as water, and assume its starts at 360 K
when pumped from oil/geothermal wells at a rate of 30 l/s, and is
cooled to 300 K.

Give the ratio of energy densities.

\edXinline{$E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo}$ =} \edXabox{expect="\$ans0" type="numerical"
  tolerance='20\%' inline='1' hintfn="hint_mag0" } 
 
\begin{edXsolution}

  If the geothermal fluid is basically just water, then its density at
  360~K is approximately 1~g/cm$^3$ (really is 0.97~g/cm$^3$ but also
  changes with temperature as heat is extracted). The heat capacity is
  approximately $c = 4.18~kJ/kg K$. If the fluid is cooled to a
  typical temperature of 300~K, then the total energy density of the
  geothermal fluid is
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{\rm geo} = \rm(4.18~kJ/kg~K)(60~K) = 251~kJ/kg
\end{equation}
Oil has an energy density of around 43~MJ/kg (wikipedia gives 46
MJ/kg).  Thus, $E_{\rm oil}/E_{\rm geo} \approx 177$, so oil has
nearly 200 times the energy density of the geothermal fluid.

input into edX auto-graded problems.
